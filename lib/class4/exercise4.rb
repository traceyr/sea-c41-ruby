# In the early days of Roman numerals, the Romans didn't bother with any of this
# new-fangled subtraction 'IX' nonsense. No sir, it was straight addition,
# biggest to littlest - so 9 was written 'VIIII' and so on.
#
# Write a method that, when passed any integer between 1 and 1000, it returns a
# string containing the proper old-school Roman numeral. In other words:
#
#   $ ruby exercise4.rb 9
#   VIIII
#
# TIP #1: Here's a mapping of Roman to Arabic numerals:
#
#   1000 = M
#    500 = D
#    100 = C
#     50 = L
#     10 = X
#      5 = V
#      1 = I
#
# TIP #2: Use the integer division and modulus methods on page 32.
#
# TIP #3: You only need to change the `old_school_roman_numeral` method.
